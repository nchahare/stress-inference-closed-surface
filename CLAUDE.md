# CLAUDE.md

Project context for Claude Code. See `README.md` for status/task tracking.

## Goal
Compute per-vertex **radius of curvature**, **vertex normals**, a **local frame
(local axes)**, and the **membrane stress** `(σ₁, σ₂)` on surface meshes. Curvature adapts
the [spatchcocking](https://github.com/nchahare/spatchcocking) method (Nature Comms
`41467_2023_38879`, supplementary PDF in repo root). Stress solves the membrane
equilibrium PDE on the surface by **generalized finite differences (GFDM)** — must stay
**general for arbitrary surfaces** (user requirement), no FEM framework, `scipy.sparse`
only. Sphere + prolate spheroid are the analytic validation cases before real meshes.

## User decisions / preferences (carry forward)
- Stress output: **only `σ₁` and `σ₂`** — do NOT compute world-frame stress or von Mises.
- Solve approach: **finite differences on the surface (GFDM)**, NOT scikit-fem, NOT
  FEniCS/Abaqus. (We explored scikit-fem 1D LSFEM and scipy.solve_bvp but the user wants a
  general surface FDM.) scikit-fem is still installed/used elsewhere if needed.
- Must generalize to **arbitrary (non-axisymmetric) surfaces**, not just bodies of revolution.
- **Always use `dp = 20` Pa** for stress runs (standing default; stress scales linearly as dp/t).
- **Final-results matrix:** 2 geometries (sphere, prolate ellipsoid 2:1) × 2 thickness
  (uniform, dorsoventral-varying) × 3 methods — **M1 Local** (curvature-only), **M2 cMSM**
  (our GFDM + Laplacian), **M3 FEM** (our OWN neo-Hookean forward FE — NOT the cMSM archive)
  = 12 sims. Config: IcoSphere subdiv-5, depth-3, dp=20 Pa, t=0.05. **M1 defined (user choice) as axisymmetric two-curvature**
  on revolutions (isotropic mean-curvature σ=Δp/2tH on arbitrary meshes, since the axisym
  split is undefined there). **Done:** Sims 1,2,7,8 + HH17/HH20 (M1+M2). **Pending:** M3 FEM
  (Sims 3,6,9,12) and the DV-thickness field (Sims 4–6,10–12). KEY: for M1/M2 thickness is
  just a 1/t divisor (statically determinate), so uniform-vs-DV science lives in the FEM.
  Results: M1≈exact on revolutions; M2 within a few % (sphere ~4% spurious deviatoric);
  HH17→HH20 cMSM σ_max 2.6e5→4.8e5, σ_min −1.4e5→−3.9e5 (HH20 stronger/more anisotropic);
  M1 isotropic unusable on real meshes (1/H blow-up). Plots: `out/final/box_compare.png`,
  `out/final/real_box_compare.png`.

## Environment — IMPORTANT
- **Always use the `fem_env` conda environment for all Python.** It has scikit-fem 12.0.1
  (Python 3.11, numpy 2.2.6) plus the vedo stack we installed.
- Interpreter: `C:\Users\nimes\miniforge3\envs\fem_env\python.exe`
- `conda` is **not on PATH**; invoke the interpreter by full path. miniforge lives at
  `C:\Users\nimes\miniforge3`.
- Installed for this project: `vedo` 2026.6.2.dev7 (git build from
  `git+https://github.com/marcomusy/vedo.git`), `vtk` 9.6.2; `scipy` already present.
- Shell is **PowerShell** (Windows 11). Run scripts as:
  `& "C:\Users\nimes\miniforge3\envs\fem_env\python.exe" sphere_curvature.py`
- Other envs exist (`ni-vedo-env` has vedo, `solidspy_env`, etc.) but this project
  standardises on `fem_env`.

## Key technical fact
The whole curvature calc rests on one vedo call:
```python
proj, poly, grid = vedo.project_point_on_variety(pt, neighbour_pts, degree=2, normal=vertex_normal)
# poly = (coeffs, R, centroid, gauss_curv K, mean_curv H)
```
- It **always returns a 3-tuple** `(proj, poly, grid)` (grid is None unless `return_grid=True`).
- `R` is a 3x3 matrix = the **local frame**: row0 = tangent `v1`, row1 = tangent `v2`,
  row2 = `normal`. This is the requested "local axes of the calculation".
- Pass the vertex normal so the mean-curvature sign is consistent.
- Principal curvatures: `disc = max(H**2 - K, 0); k1 = H + sqrt(disc); k2 = H - sqrt(disc)`;
  principal radii `r1 = 1/k1`, `r2 = 1/k2`.

## Mesh / neighbourhood pattern (vedo)
```python
mesh = vedo.Sphere(r=R, res=40)
mesh.compute_normals()
adlist = mesh.compute_adjacency()
neigh = mesh.find_adjacent_vertices(i, depth=depth, adjacency_list=adlist)  # k-ring
pts = mesh.coordinates ; normals = mesh.vertex_normals
```
`depth` controls neighbourhood size for the fit (default 3). Need >= 6 points for degree-2.

## Membrane stress — method & key facts
- PDE solved: `div_s(N) + Δp·n = 0` for the tangential stress tensor `N`. Worked in
  **ambient (global Cartesian) components** so frame-rotation/connection terms are
  implicit → works on arbitrary surfaces. The normal component of this equation IS the
  Laplace law `σ₁κ₁+σ₂κ₂=Δp/t`; tangential components are in-plane equilibrium.
- **GFDM operators** (`surface_fd.py`): per-vertex WLS quadratic Taylor fit in the tangent
  plane gives sparse `G_ξ, G_η` with `(G_ξ f)_i ≈ ∂f/∂ξ`. Validated → ~2nd-order convergence.
- **DOFs**: 3 per vertex `(p,q,r)` for `N = p t1⊗t1 + q t2⊗t2 + r(t1⊗t2+t2⊗t1)` (builds in `N·n=0`).
- **Solve** (`membrane_stress_fd.py`): assemble sparse `L` (3n×3n), Tikhonov-smoothed
  least squares `(LᵀL + λ²RᵀR) S = Lᵀb`, `b = -Δp·n`. `σ₁,σ₂ = eig([[p,r],[r,q]])/t`.
- **Principal curvature frame variant** (`membrane_stress_fd_v2.py`): same solve, but uses
  `e1, e2` (principal curvature directions from `compute_curvature_frame`) as the tangent
  frame instead of the arbitrary fit frame `v1, v2`. DOFs then represent
  `N = p e1⊗e1 + q e2⊗e2 + r(e1⊗e2+e2⊗e1)`. Result: `σ₁,σ₂` are **identical** to v1
  (eigenvalues are frame-independent). New outputs: **`d1`, `d2`** (principal stress directions
  in world R³) via `θ_s = ½ arctan2(2r, p−q)` → `d1 = cos θ_s · e1 + sin θ_s · e2`, and
  the **`r` shear diagnostic** (|r|/(|p|+|q|) ≈ 1–2% on axisymmetric surfaces → ~0 when stress
  and curvature axes coincide; non-trivial on general meshes).
- **Principal curvature dirs ≠ principal stress dirs in general.** They coincide only when
  geometry and loading share the same symmetry (axisymmetric surface + uniform pressure). On
  general meshes `r≠0` in the curvature frame — the stress principal axes tilt away from the
  curvature axes to satisfy global in-plane equilibrium. The shear `r` quantifies this tilt.
- **Also returns `d1`, `d2`**: principal stress direction unit vectors in world R³; arrows from
  these on the 3-panel vedo plot (sphere + spheroid + capsule) make the stress field visually
  interpretable.
- **Closed-surface null modes**: `L` has spurious near-null ("hourglass") modes that show up
  as streaky "lines" along the icosphere triangulation. Tikhonov smoothing (`λ≈0.01–0.05`)
  suppresses oscillatory ones; use **IcoSphere** (not UV `Sphere`) to avoid pole artifacts.
  Spurious deviatoric ~5–7%, converges slowly to ~4% with subdiv5+depth3.
- **Best fix for the lines = Laplacian (umbrella) post-smoothing** (`stress_smoothing_compare.py`):
  `σ ← (1-α)σ + α·mean_1ring(σ)`, ~12 iters, α=0.5. Sphere σ_max std 0.69→0.15 (~4.5×);
  spheroid streaks gone, real hoop band preserved. Display/report the smoothed field; keep
  raw σ in data.
- **IMPORTANT correction:** the artifact is *whole-field*, NOT just deviatoric. The MEAN
  stress (σ₁+σ₂)/2 also carries the lines (sphere mean-stress std ≈6.8%). Do NOT claim "mean
  stress is clean" — it isn't. Mean is accurate only in the *median*; smoothing is the cure.
- A genus-0 surface has NO smooth divergence-free traceless tensor field, so on the sphere
  σ₁=σ₂ exactly — any anisotropy there is pure discretization error (useful sanity check).
- **Beltrami stress function (IMPLEMENTED, `membrane_stress_beltrami.py`)**: unknown is a
  single scalar Φ → no tensor null space → removes the lines STRUCTURALLY (no smoothing;
  sphere σ_max std 0.69→0.16). Key curved-surface facts learned:
    - Airy is NOT div-free on curved surfaces (`div_s N(Φ) ∝ K·∇Φ`), and it can only carry
      self-equilibrated stress — NOT the pressure on a closed surface. So split
      `N = N_p + N_Airy(Φ)`: particular `N_p = (Δp/tr B)·g` (isotropic, exact on sphere) +
      Airy `N_Airy = cof(Hess_s Φ)` (local: `N11=Φ_ηη, N22=Φ_ξξ, N12=-Φ_ξη`, from the WLS
      Hessian / `build_derivative_operators` in `surface_fd.py`).
    - `B` (2nd fundamental form, local frame) from Weingarten `+grad_s n` (SIGN: use `+`, so
      tr B = 2H > 0 and σ is tensile under Δp>0; the `-` gives flipped/negative σ — a bug we hit).
    - Solve LS for Φ: tangential-equilibrium residual + `wn·(N_Airy:B)` (normal-preservation)
      + tiny `eps·Φ` (Φ has a constant null space). `wn≈1` is the sweet spot.
  - **Tradeoff (honest):** removes lines but the 1-scalar ansatz + 3rd-order GFDM doesn't
    satisfy tangential equilibrium well on the spheroid (resid ~0.9) → UNDER-predicts anisotropy
    (σ_min ~40% off; σ_max ~9%). So **Laplacian-smoothed direct solve is still the best
    *accurate* method**; Beltrami is the principled line-removal that needs accuracy refinement
    (better high-order operators / handle K∇Φ / two-potential Gauss–Codazzi).
- Analytic validation refs (axisymmetric, in `analytic_axisym`): sphere σ=ΔpR/2t; spheroid
  `N_φ=Δp·r2/2`, `N_θ=Δp·r2(1−r2/2r1)`, with `r1=J³/(ab)`, `r2=bJ/a`, `J=√(a²sin²β+b²cos²β)`.
- **cMSM = the reference method we adapt** (Marín-Llauradó et al., Nat Commun 2023, Supp Note 2;
  MATLAB code downloaded to `cMSM_ref/`, Zenodo 7921052). Same physics (`div_s σ=0`, `σ:κ=ΔP`,
  statically determinate, constitutive-free), but they use globally-parametrized linear-triangle
  FEM → **open domes only**; we use local-frame GFDM → **closed/arbitrary surfaces** (our niche).
  Both avoid Christoffel symbols in the balance operator by the same trick (they interpolate
  `s^b=√g σ^ab e_a`; we use ambient components). For the R3 cross-check we **run our own
  neo-Hookean FEM** — do NOT reuse the archived cMSM `.mat` fields (`cMSM_ref/MeshData/NeoHookean/`):
  their geometries, material parameters, and 400 Pa loading differ from ours, so they are not a
  valid ground truth. `cMSM_ref/` is an implementation reference only.
- **cMSM regularization TESTED and RULED OUT for closed surfaces** (`reg_compare.py`): ported their
  1st-order grad-trace (`λ_t`) + curl (`λ_c`) penalty into our GFDM solve. Covariant derivative
  needs no Christoffel: `∇_α N_βγ = (v_β)_a(v_γ)_b (G_α N_ab)`; in 2D curl-penalty == full
  covariant-gradient norm. **Finding:** on closed sphere/spheroid it performs like our *raw*
  Tikhonov (sphere σ_max std stays 0.69; spheroid σ_min err ~38%), and a λ_t/λ_c sweep plateaus
  spurious anisotropy at ~10%. The **Laplacian post-smoothing dominates** regardless of regularizer
  (cMSM+Laplacian ≈ Tikhonov+Laplacian). Reason: closed-surface null mode tracks the icosahedral
  pattern (low-k), which a gradient penalty can't kill without flattening the real signal; their
  penalty relies on the open-dome pinned boundary we don't have. So **do NOT adopt cMSM reg** —
  Laplacian smoothing is necessary and sufficient. Details in `stress_estimation.tex` §6.
- **cMSM validation methodology (from the supplement, 41467_2023_38879_MOESM1_ESM.pdf §2.3.1/§2.4) —
  how THEY quantified validity:** (i) **metric = trace(σ)=σ₁+σ₂** ("hydrostatic / mean surface
  tension") — their MOST robustly-recovered quantity (errors much smaller over a wider λ range,
  because the grad-trace `λ_t` penalty directly smooths trace∇); we now default the FEM viewer to it.
  (ii) **error = `‖σ−σ_ref‖/‖σ_ref‖`** at all nodes vs ground truth: closed-form for axisym
  (sphere/prolate/oblate caps) AND a **forward neo-Hookean FEM** (ΔP=400 Pa, μ=1 mN/m) — cMSM recovered
  **within ~3% of FEM** (target for our M3). (iii) **λ chosen by L-curve** (reg functional `√(uᵀQu/A)`
  vs residual `‖Au−b‖/‖b‖`): the **corner** = optimal λ_t = min-error point = onset of residual
  increase; for experimental data (no ground truth) this L-curve corner is the selector. Confirms our
  "residual is a diagnostic not the objective" (λ=0 → residual ~1e-5 but error largest). (iv) **det σ>0
  inequality constraint** (positive principal tensions) for flat/concave K≤0 regions that can't hold a
  membrane stress (fmincon) — relevant to embryo folds / our compressive-σ_min. (v) Stress **glyph =
  orthogonal arrow-pair cross**, arms ∝ principal tension, divergence/convergence = sign; black=inferred,
  green=expected. They emphasize membrane inference is statically DETERMINATE (unlike TFM) but `Au=b`
  is still ill-conditioned even for a sphere ⇒ regularization needed.
- **One-to-one cMSM-Fig-15 reproduction (`cmsm_sphere_compare.py`) — WE DO get their L-curve.**
  Sweeps our single FEM Tikhonov λ (1e-4→50) on the CLOSED sphere and lays our 3 diagnostics under
  cMSM's actual Fig-15 panels (auto-cropped from the supplement PDF page idx 29 via pymupdf) →
  `out/cmsm_sphere_compare.png`. **Findings (subdiv-4, dp=20, t=0.05):** (i) our error-vs-λ is
  **U-shaped** like theirs (min **2.6%** full-σ / 2.3% trace — vs their <1%; the gap is the
  closed-surface penalty: no pinned boundary, local frames, icosahedral mesh); (ii) residual is flat
  (~1e-3) then rises sharply — same shape as their panel (c); (iii) the **L-curve has a clear corner**.
  KEY CAVEAT: on the closed sphere the L-curve corner (λ≈0.1) and the min-error λ (≈0.49) do NOT
  coincide — error keeps dropping PAST the corner because the sphere's true field is constant
  isotropic, so smoothing the (spurious) anisotropy is always beneficial and never destroys signal.
  cMSM flag the sphere as "special" for exactly this reason. ⇒ **the sphere is a BAD λ-calibration
  target** (it pushes λ too high, ~0.5); tune λ on the SPHEROID (genuine anisotropy → corner ≈
  min-error ≈ 0.05, per `fem_regularization_study.py`). So the L-curve machinery works; just don't
  calibrate it on the sphere. Note: our R (FEM-native 1-ring covariant-gradient norm) is a single
  combined penalty, analogous to cMSM's λ_t+λ_c — we don't split grad-trace vs curl.
- **Laplacian post-smoothing DROPPED for the FEM — one knob (Tikhonov λ), not two
  (`fem_smoothing_sweep.py`, tension_inference §12 `sec:fem-smoothing`).** Joint λ×iters sweep
  (α=0.5, m∈{0,4,8,12,16}, smoothing the DOFs and recomputing resid/roughness) on 4 shapes →
  `out/fem_smoothing_sweep_{sphere,prolate,oblate,capsule}.png` + per-vertex NPZ. **Result: on
  every shape with GENUINE stress variation (prolate err 2.47%, oblate 6.72%, capsule 2.19%) the
  optimum is m=0** — Laplacian can't beat Tikhonov-λ because any pass that kills the spurious
  anisotropy also flattens the real meridional/hoop signal at the same wavelength, and it always
  RAISES the residual (panel c). **Only the SPHERE benefits** (3.45%→1.29% at m=16) — its constant
  isotropic field has no real signal to damage (same degeneracy as the λ-calibration caveat). ⇒
  regularize the FEM with the single Tikhonov λ at the L-curve corner; the Laplacian was a GFDM-era
  patch. (α,iters collapse to one scale m·α since one pass = M=(1−α)I+αA, mode decay ~e^{−mα(1−μ)}.)
  Each figure = cMSM-Fig-15 layout (a err/λ, b σ₁ vs latitude+analytic, c resid/λ, d L-curve),
  colored by iters.
- **Mesh resolution requirement (embryo) — `mesh_resolution_study.py`, tension_inference §10.7.**
  The controlling variable is the dimensionless **`h·κ`** (mesh spacing × curvature = 1/elements-
  per-curvature-radius). Error vs `h·κ`: sphere needs `h·κ≲0.05` (~20 elem/radius) for ~3%;
  spheroid more forgiving (<4% at `h·κ≈0.18`). **HH20 embryo (n=3766) sits at h·κ≈0.17 median,
  0.44 p90 — COARSER than our coarsest test (sphere subdiv-3 h·κ=0.14).** ⇒ worst-case (high-
  curvature folds) error ≳10%; smooth tube-body ~few %. Uniform refinement to h·κ=0.05 needs
  ~4e4 verts (~3e5 to fix the p90 tail) → **use curvature-ADAPTIVE refinement, not uniform**;
  ship a per-vertex `h·κ` quality map, flag `h·κ>0.1` as low-confidence.
- **λ=0.05 confirmed near-optimal** (same study): spheroid λ-sweep is U-shaped — σ_max err min
  0.9% at λ=0.05, rises to 5.8% at λ=0.2 (over-smooths anisotropy); λ=0.005 leaves 6.6% (null
  modes). At λ=0 on the sphere ε≈1e-7 but error ~1900% → **residual is a diagnostic, NOT the
  objective; the correct ε at the optimum is ~2e-2, not the smallest achievable.**
- **Solve timing & scaling** (sphere, depth-3, this machine): sd3 (n=642) 0.7s · sd4 (2562) 7.6s ·
  sd5 (10242) **267s** · sd6 (40962, lsqr) 532s. Direct sparse solve on the normal equations
  `(LᵀL+λ²RᵀR)` scales ~×35 per ×4 dof (depth-3 stencil ~30 nnz/row → LᵀL ~900 nnz/row, heavy
  fill-in). `lsqr_thresh=60000` dof (=20k verts) is **too high**: sd5 (30726 dof) stays on the
  slow direct path (267s) when lsqr would be faster — lower the threshold (~20–30k dof) so sd5+
  use iterative. Embryo (n=3766, ~11k dof) ≈ 15–30s direct. A 4e4-vertex adaptive target ≈ sd6
  territory (~9 min, lsqr).
- **Two added reference papers (root PDFs), bracket our method (tension_inference §11):**
  **Romo et al. 2014** (*J. Biomech.* 47(3):607–616, ATAA bulge-inflation) = the SAME inverse
  method on real tissue — their Eq.(6) IS our `div_s N+Δp·n=0`, solved nodally, explicitly
  "without a constitutive model"; open dome w/ boundary tractions (like cMSM); **passive**;
  headline = **rupture ≠ max-stress location** (it's where stress meets local thinning/weakness).
  **Bal et al. 2026** (*JMPS* 208:106477, active-gel→continuum shell) = forward active theory;
  stress `σ=σ_elastic+ξρg` (myosin active term ξ); needs Cosserat (through-thickness) for
  apicobasal-asymmetry **bending**. Lineage we complete: Romo/cMSM (open) → us (closed/arbitrary
  = the niche).
- **Fluid-vs-elastic / heterogeneous tension (tension_inference §3.4 — conceptual key fact):**
  a CLEAN FLUID interface has isotropic `N=γP`; tangential equilibrium then demands `∇_s γ=0`,
  so a static bubble CANNOT hold heterogeneous tension (gradient = unbalanced Marangoni force →
  flow homogenises it). On a SOLID-LIKE membrane `N` is a full tensor, and a varying scalar
  tension `N=γ(x)P+N_dev` is only in tangential equilibrium if `∇_s γ` is balanced by
  `div_s N_dev` ⇒ **heterogeneous tension FORCES anisotropy/shear** (this is why `r≠0` and d₁
  tilts off the curvature axes on general meshes). Determinacy by dof-count: fluid = 1 unknown
  (over-constrained to uniform), elastic = 3 unknowns vs 3 eqs (the real inverse problem). The
  inference is meaningful ONLY because the tissue is solid-like.
- **Neural-tube novel angle (tension_inference §11, NOT YET data-verified):** inference gives the
  TOTAL membrane tension; static determinacy fixes the sum but CANNOT split `N=N_elastic+N_active`
  (Bal) — need ablation/pMLC or a forward model for that. Two equilibrium-derived **active
  signatures** we ALREADY compute (forbidden for a passive pressurised convex membrane):
  (i) **principal-axis tilt** (shear `δ=|r|/(|p|+|q|)`) and (ii) **compressive σ_min<0**. Testable
  thesis: HH17→HH20 tension rise/anisotropy is accompanied by growing δ and compressive zones
  localising at high-`h·κ` folds; those active-signature regions (not peak-tension) mark active
  shape change. **TODO when ready: verify δ + σ_min<0 actually localise coherently on saved HH20.**
- **Stress-based FEM — PRIMARY ENGINE (`membrane_stress_fem.py`, tension_inference §12).**
  The chosen method for closed/arbitrary surfaces. Solves `div_s N+Δp·n=0` via **primal
  virtual-work / cMSM-style** weak form (`∫ N:ε_s(w)=∫ Δp·n·w`, P1 nodal stress trial + P1
  vector test → SQUARE 3n×3n); hand-rolled `scipy.sparse`. **Assembly:** per-tri P1 surface-grad
  `g_j=(n_T×opp_j)/(2A_T)`; element block `(A_T/3)·Σ_{m∈T}(N_m g_j)_d`; consistent load P1
  mass `M^T_jm=(A_T/12)(1+δ)`. **Roughness = FEM-NATIVE** `R`: area-weighted P1 surface-gradient
  of stress components → `‖Rs‖²=∫Σ_ab|∇_s N_ab|²`. **Scale fix (KEY):** `w=λ·‖K‖_F/‖R‖_F`
  (K area-weighted ~h, R~O(1); bare λ mis-scales by ~h⁻⁴). **Solve:** K SINGULAR on closed
  surfaces; (i) raw min-norm `lsqr` (lines diagnostic, `raw=True`), (ii) Tikhonov direct
  `(KᵀK+w²RᵀR)` or auto-`lsqr` on `[K;wR]` above 20k DOFs. σ₁,σ₂=eig([[p,r],[r,q]])/t.
  **RESULTS (subdiv-4, dp=20, t=0.05):** raw dev-std **216** → confirms lines are INTRINSIC to
  the indeterminacy (not a GFDM artefact); cMSM is singular on closed surfaces. Regularised:
  sphere mean 0.3%, dev-std 4.4; spheroid σ_max 1.7%, σ_min ~19%. **~5–12× FASTER than GFDM**
  (sd4 2.0s, sd5 9.2s) — KᵀK 6.6× sparser (57 vs 376 nnz/row) + no WLS build. **Optimal λ
  ≈ 0.3 on the closed prolate spheroid** (L-curve corner = min-error; `fem_regularization_study.py`
  U-shaped sweep); calibrate on the spheroid (genuine anisotropy), not the sphere (constant field
  → no true optimum, corner and min-error diverge). `--show` = interactive viewer, `--raw` shows
  the lines. Runners-up ruled out: LSFEM (SPD GFDM twin), mixed Hellinger–Reissner (needs
  compliance; H(div) surface elements unsupported).
- **Auto-λ per mesh: `solve_membrane_fem(..., lam="auto")`** (or CLI `--lam auto`). Runs a one-off
  λ-sweep (default geomspace(1e-3,1,16)), picks λ at the **residual-onset elbow** (max-dist-from-chord
  of (log λ, log resid) — cMSM's panel-c rule, NO ground truth needed; `_elbow`/`_lcurve_corner`/
  `select_lambda_lcurve`). Returns `res["lam"]` (numeric used) + `res["lcurve"]` (swept lams/resid/reg/idx);
  printed in reports + shown in viewer titles. NOTE: λ is dimensionless (Frobenius-matched) so it's
  refinement-invariant for a fixed geometry — only re-select for a NEW shape. The elbow is deliberately
  CONSERVATIVE on closed surfaces (residual lifts off before min-error, so auto-λ ~1e-2 < error-optimal
  ~1e-1) → favors equilibrium fidelity + sharp σ_max over σ_min; override with explicit λ if needed.
  (Menger curvature + the (resid,reg) 2D elbow were tried and rejected: too low / endpoint-sensitive.)
- **Forward neo-Hookean membrane = M3, IMPLEMENTED (`forward_neohookean.py`, `forward_membrane.tex`).**
  Inflates a stress-free reference surface under internal pressure → a UNIQUE, null-mode-free stress
  field (the constitutive law picks one member of the self-equilibrated family that makes the INVERSE
  ill-posed). Energy `Π=Σ A0·W − Δp·V` minimised by **L-BFGS + analytic gradient** (CST P1 membrane,
  follower pressure, free-floating closed body — 6 rigid modes are flat, no pinning); σ=(1/J)F S Fᵀ →
  σ1,σ2. **Model = stress-free INCOMPRESSIBLE NH `W=µ_s(I+J⁻²−3)`, NOT cMSM's compressible
  µ(I−2)+λ(J−1)²** — the latter has a reference pre-tension 2µ that breaks the stiff-reference trick.
  **Stiff-reference strategy:** target shape as stress-free ref + stiff µ_s → small deformation
  (`drift`=max‖x−X‖/mean‖X‖), so σ is the equilibrium tension ON the (≈unchanged) shape. **Validated
  ~10× tighter than the inverse solve:** sphere (stretch 0.00%, isotropy 0.37%), prolate (anisotropy
  1.744 vs 1.749, belt err 0.36%), capsule (hoop/axial 0.2%). **Oblate:** analytic σ_min compressive
  (−19.7) → a membrane WRINKLES (no bending) → σ_min→0, drift↑; this is cMSM's det σ>0 territory but we
  DON'T impose it (just want the pattern). **Peanut neck (`forward_saddle_demo.py`): K<0 saddle stays
  TENSILE under internal pressure** ⇒ negative Gaussian curvature does NOT force compression; the OBLATE
  (K>0, r2>2r1) does. Sign of σ is set by Young-Laplace + global balance, not by sign(K). `--mesh <file>`
  runs arbitrary closed meshes (drops degenerate tris, normalizes to unit radius → pattern is
  scale-invariant, orients faces outward); `--decimate N` coarsens (HH17 64k→3766 to match HH20).
  **HH17 vs HH20 (`forward_compare_hh.py`, common scale):** HH20 trace median 8.26 > HH17 7.59 (size
  effect, HH20 1.72× bigger → higher Laplace tension; matches inverse HH17→HH20 rise); HH17 has more
  compressive patches + drifts ~13% (wrinkles, more folded). Normalize EACH to unit radius = shape-only
  (HH17 higher); common scale = size-corrected (HH20 higher). Saves per-mesh `.vtp` (all σ fields on the
  deformed mesh) + `--load` to re-view without re-solving.

## Files
- `sphere_curvature.py` — per-vertex curvature, normals, local axes (`compute_vertex_frames`).
- `INSTALL.md` / `environment.yml` / `requirements.txt` — install + getting-started for new users
  (conda `fem_env` or pip; verify commands; gitignored data files). Deps: numpy/scipy/matplotlib/
  vedo(+vtk); pymupdf/Pillow optional. NOTE: despite the repo name, scikit-fem (and meshio) are NOT
  imported by any script — the GFDM/FEM/forward solvers are hand-rolled scipy; both were dropped.
- `curvature_compare.py` — mean curvature + normal arrows, sphere vs stretched.
- `forward_neohookean.py` — **forward NH membrane inflation (M3)**: stress-free incompressible
  `W=µ_s(I+J⁻²−3)`, CST P1 membrane, energy-min L-BFGS + analytic gradient, follower pressure,
  free-floating closed body. `--shape sphere|prolate|oblate|capsule` (analytic validation) or
  `--mesh <file>` (+`--decimate N`) for arbitrary closed meshes (HH20). `--mu`(stiffness) `--dp`
  `--field` `--vmin/--vmax` `--save`(offscreen PNG) `--show`. Reusable: `reference_geometry`,
  `energy_and_grad`, `recover_stress`, `load_normalized_mesh`.
- `forward_saddle_demo.py` — peanut/dumbbell (K<0 neck) inflation; correlates σ_min with Gaussian
  curvature → shows K<0 stays tensile (no compression under internal pressure).
- `forward_compare_hh.py` — HH17(decimated)+HH20 forward solve on a COMMON scale, 2-panel
  side-by-side with a diverging colorbar (red tension / blue compression). Saves per-mesh `.vtp`
  (all σ fields on the deformed mesh); `--load` re-views without re-solving. `--field --mu --maxiter`.
- `forward_membrane.tex`/`.pdf` — forward-problem derivation: kinematics, membrane NH constitutive,
  energy/weak form + follower pressure (pressure vs volume control), CST FE, free-floating BCs
  (3-2-1 / rigid-mode projection), Newton/L-BFGS, Results (4 shapes + peanut + HH20), packages.
- `surface_fd.py` — GFDM surface-derivative operators + self-test.
- `membrane_stress_fd.py` — direct GFDM membrane-stress solve (σ₁, σ₂); arbitrary fit frame.
- `membrane_stress_fem.py` — **stress-based FEM** (§12): primal virtual-work, P1 nodal local-frame
  DOFs, square 3n system, FEM-native 1-ring roughness, auto-iterative; `assemble_fem`,
  `fem_roughness_operator`, `solve_membrane_fem`, `plot_fem`/`cross_glyphs`/`stress_scalar`.
  Returns σ₁/σ₂ + principal **directions d₁/d₂** (θ_s=½arctan2(2r,p−q) in the fit frame). Viewer
  colours by **trace σ₁+σ₂** (cMSM's metric, default; `--field trace|vonmises|mean|shear|sigma_max|sigma_min`)
  + draws **principal-stress crosses** (±d₁/±d₂ segments, arms ∝|σᵢ|, red=tension/blue=compression —
  mirrors cMSM's arrow-pair glyph). ~5–12× faster than GFDM, ≥ accuracy; raw min-norm reproduces the
  lines (intrinsic). `--show`/`--raw`.
- `fem_validation.py` — reproduces the GFDM §10 battery for the FEM: convergence (subdiv 3–5,
  FEM vs GFDM), linearity (σ∝Δp/t), analytic benchmark (sphere/spheroid/capsule via `make_capsule`),
  λ tradeoff → `out/fem_validation.png` + tables. Reuses `one_ring_avg`/`laplacian_smooth` from
  `convergence_study`, `analytic_axisym` from `membrane_stress_fd`, `make_capsule` from `show_capsule`.
- `cmsm_sphere_compare.py` — **one-to-one cMSM Fig-15 reproduction** on the closed sphere: sweeps the
  FEM Tikhonov λ and stacks our (error-vs-λ, residual-vs-λ, L-curve) under cMSM's own Fig-15 panels
  (auto-cropped from the supplement PDF via pymupdf → `out/cmsm_ref/grid_abcd.png`) →
  `out/cmsm_sphere_compare.png`. We reproduce their U-error + L-curve; sphere optimum λ≈0.5 is
  artificially high (calibrate λ on the spheroid, not here). Flags: `--subdiv --nlam`.
- `fem_regularization_study.py` — cMSM-Fig-15-style λ-sweep on the prolate **spheroid** (the case
  with genuine anisotropy → a real optimum exists ≈0.05): error(trace vs full σ)/residual/L-curve +
  3D trace(σ) glyph with inferred-vs-analytic crosses → `out/fem_regularization.png`.
- `fem_smoothing_sweep.py` — joint **λ × Laplacian-iters** sweep on 4 shapes (sphere, prolate,
  oblate, capsule); cMSM-Fig-15 layout per shape, curves colored by iters; smooths the DOFs and
  recomputes resid/roughness so both respond to iters. → `out/fem_smoothing_sweep_<shape>.png` +
  per-vertex `.npz` (sigma1/2, pqr DOFs, frames, faces, coord, mask, metrics — for later 3D plots).
  Conclusion: m=0 optimal except on the sphere ⇒ FEM drops Laplacian. Flags: `--shapes --subdiv
  --nlam --iters`. Has `build_mesh(shape,subdiv)` + `analytic_coord_mask(shape,pts)` reused elsewhere.
- `export_fem_vtk.py` — solve FEM on the 4 shapes, write `out/fem_vtk/fem_<shape>.vtp` (ParaView):
  per-vertex σ₁/σ₂, σ_max/σ_min, trace/mean/vonmises/shear, N1/N2, dir vectors d₁/d₂, normal, and
  analytic σ_max/σ_min/trace + belt_mask. Default `--lam auto` (prints lam per shape). Flags:
  `--shapes --subdiv --dp --t --lam --outdir`.
- `membrane_stress_fd_v2.py` — same solve in the **principal curvature frame** (e1, e2 from
  `compute_curvature_frame`); adds `d1`, `d2` (principal stress directions, world R³), `r`
  shear diagnostic, and per-vertex `resid_pv`; includes `make_capsule` and `plot_stress_frame`
  (3-panel vedo plot: sphere + spheroid + capsule, mesh coloured by σ₁, white d1 segments).
  **`save_results`/`smooth_results`** write per-vertex NPZ + VTP (resultants `N1`/`N2` stored
  separately from σ so varying-`t` needs no re-solve; `t_field` always per-vertex).
- `stress_smoothing_compare.py` — Laplacian smoothing of σ; raw vs smoothed vs mean (2×3 grid).
- `membrane_stress_beltrami.py` — Beltrami/Airy stress-function solve (single scalar Φ).
- `reg_compare.py` — cMSM-style (grad-trace + curl) regularization vs our Laplacian smoothing,
  sphere + spheroid (imports operators from `membrane_stress_fd`/`surface_fd`). → `out/reg_compare.png`.
- `real_mesh_stress.py` — full pipeline for HH17/HH20 VTK meshes; auto-decimates; CSV/NPZ/VTP.
- `view_smoothed.py` — interactive viewer of smoothed σ from saved `.vtp` (sharecam=False).
- `local_stress.py` — **M1 local stress**: `local_stress_axisym` (axisym two-curvature for
  revolutions: σ_merid=Δp·r_hoop/2t, σ_hoop=Δp·r_hoop/t·(1−r_hoop/2r_merid), with κ_hoop=(n·ρ̂)/ρ
  geometric + κ_merid=2H−κ_hoop) and `local_stress_isotropic` (σ=Δp/2tH, any surface).
- `final_sims.py` — final-results runner: sphere+ellipsoid, M1+M2, IcoSphere subdiv5 dp=20 →
  `out/final/sim0*.{csv,npz,vtp}` + metrics vs analytic.
- `final_real.py` — final-results runner: HH17 (decimated to HH20's ~3766 pts) + HH20, M1
  (isotropic) + M2 → `out/final/hh*_{local,cmsm}.*`.
- `view_final.py` — interactive viewer, SHARED colour limits per group (sphere↔ellipsoid;
  HH17↔HH20). CLI: `--group {analytic,real} --method {m1,m2} --field`.
- `box_compare.py` — box plot Local vs cMSM vs analytical (sphere+ellipsoid) → `out/final/box_compare.png`.
- `real_box_compare.py` — box plot HH17 vs HH20 side-by-side (Local & cMSM) → `out/final/real_box_compare.png`.
- `cMSM_ref/` — downloaded reference cMSM MATLAB code (Zenodo 7921052), implementation
  reference only — its FEM data is NOT our ground truth (we run our own FEM for M3).
- `surface_fd.py` also has `build_derivative_operators` → 1st+2nd derivative ops (g_xi,g_eta,h_xixi,h_xieta,h_etaeta).
- `stress_estimation.tex` / `.pdf` — equations, method, results (compile with `pdflatex` TWICE
  for refs; MiKTeX present). Embeds figures from `out/`.
- `tension_inference.tex` / `.pdf` — standalone mathematical derivation (continuously updated;
  has a **bibliography** now: Bal 2026, Calladine, Flügge, Marín-Llauradó 2023, Romo 2014,
  Timoshenko). **NOTE: the new front section shifted ALL section numbers +1** (sectioning was
  re-derived 2026-06-18). Current layout: **§1 elastostatics framing** (problem class, governing
  eq + 2 projections, static determinacy, 4 method families, constitutive ladder M1/M2/M3 — NEW),

  bias **§5.5**, Tikhonov + direct-vs-lsqr **§5.6**), §6 curvature frame, §7 principal stress
  directions d₁/d₂, §8 summary, §9 validation cases, **§10 validation suite (mostly run)**:
  §10.1 benchmarks, §10.2 convergence, §10.3 linearity, §10.4 residual maps, §10.7 mesh-resolution
  (`h·κ`) + timing; §10.5/10.6/10.8 (shear, smoothing, FEM) still proposed. **§11 biological
  interpretation: neural-tube tension landscape** — NEW, synthesises Romo 2014 + Bal 2026 (see
  key-facts bullet below). **§12 stress-based FEM chapter** — NEW, **IMPLEMENTED**
  (`membrane_stress_fem.py`) with results table + timing (see key-facts bullet below).

## Conventions
- Keep code self-contained; do **not** install the full spatchcocking package (drags in
  opencv/tifffile). Adapt the needed function only.
- Headless by default; only open vedo windows behind `--show`. Long solves: run in background.
- Note: Python buffers stdout when not a TTY → background-run prints appear only at exit.
- Validate every new path against the analytical sphere (and spheroid) before trusting it.
